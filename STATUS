- delete doesn't work
- we send pushes too frequently
  - setting pushDelay to zero means we frequently send more than one push per frame, and we always send many duplicate mutations
  - setting pushDelay to 16ms results in frequently missing a frame
- need to look carefully at whether batching of mutations and timestamps working as intended
- need to implement delay of mutation application on receive side
- app-side integration is a disaster, need to think through changes necessary to replicache to support correctly
- did not quite finish up unit testing for process-pending and process-until-done
- a lot of the tests were broken by integrate changes
- trying to integrate, open PR with miscellaneous problems fixed
- sending mutations from future (lmid > present) is infinite loop
- make log levels per fritz doc
- make log level configurable
