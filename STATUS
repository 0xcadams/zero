# Now

- connection management
- reboot server when it crashes
- continuous testing and deploy
- did not quite finish up unit testing for process-pending and process-until-done
- a lot of the tests were broken by integrate changes
- stacking
- color picking
- new tweet + make public? :)
- get feedback from customers on usage preferences:
  - use as service
  - use as library
  - use as pattern?

# Next

- generally speaking the interface to replicache needs to be reworked:
  - need a proper "connect" message or a way to get the cookie other than faking the puller
  - need to get rid of backoff or be able to bypass
  - need pusher to only send new items
  - (not needed for this but useful) - pusher should be already parsed
  - poke needs support for delay
- make log levels per fritz doc
- make log level configurable
- idea for refactoring top level
  - make main basically be an infinite loop that is reading off a generator which is
    merging the pending queues
  - each time we receive a push, the delay gets reset
  - need to rework how peek() works

later:

- undo?
