# Reflect Server

Package for running Reflect Multiplayer Server on Cloudflare Workers.

See [example](example/index.ts).

See [Server API](doc/server-api.md) for the API that Reflect Server exposes. (There is also a more advanced [Server dev API](doc/server-dev-api.md) that can be handy for development or migration.)
